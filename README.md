# Titamas Online

A small-group (1–10 player) co-op 3D RPG set in the world of Titamas. Built in **Godot 4.6** with GDScript. Levels and characters are made in Blender.

## Running it

1. Pull with GitHub Desktop.
2. Open Godot 4.6, click **Import**, pick this folder's `project.godot`.
3. Press **F5** (Play). The test level loads.

**Controls (milestone 1):** WASD move · Shift sprint · Space jump · hold right mouse to look · mouse wheel zoom.

## Folder layout

| Folder | What goes there |
| --- | --- |
| `scenes/` | Godot scenes (`levels/`, `player/`, `ui/`) |
| `scripts/` | GDScript, mirroring `scenes/` |
| `assets/models/` | Exported `.glb` files Godot imports |
| `assets/levels/` | Exported level chunk `.glb` files |
| `assets/source/` | Source `.blend` files (not imported directly) |
| `data/` | Item, ability, quest and NPC data (later) |

## Blender conventions

- **Scale:** 1 unit = 1 metre. Characters about 1.8 m tall.
- **Export:** File → Export → glTF 2.0, format **glTF Binary (.glb)**, +Y Up on.
- **Characters:** Mixamo skeleton (`mixamorig:` bones), same names on masc and femme bodies.
- **Collision via name suffixes** (Godot reads these on import):
  - `-col` → visible mesh with matching collision
  - `-colonly` → invisible collision only (blockers, simplified terrain)
  - `-convcolonly` → invisible convex collision (cheap, for simple props)
  - `-noimp` → not imported (reference objects)

## Level chunks

- Chunks are square tiles on a fixed grid (64 m × 64 m for now), with the chunk's origin at its centre.
- No sky cube: the sky is Godot's `WorldEnvironment`. Model only ground and props.
- Terrain edges must line up with neighbours: border vertices sit exactly on the chunk edge at the same spacing (every 2 m), with matching heights.
- `chunk_I_J` is centred at Godot (I×64, 0, J×64), which is Blender (I×64, −J×64, 0). I grows east (+X), J grows south (Blender −Y).
- Connections that aren't on the grid (cave mouths, building doors) use **connector empties** named `CONN_<name>`; matching names snap together.

## Terrain add-on (Blender 4.1)

`tools/blender/titamas_terrain.py` makes and exports seamless chunks.

1. Blender → Edit → Preferences → Add-ons → **Install…** → pick the file → tick **Titamas Terrain Chunks**.
2. In the 3D Viewport press **N** → **Titamas** tab.
3. Set how many chunks east and south, press **New Terrain**. It's placed on the grid with 2 m vertex spacing, and sculpting is locked to up/down so the grid stays straight.
4. Sculpt freely across chunk borders. Save the .blend.
5. With the terrain selected, press **Export Chunks**. Each chunk is saved as `chunks/chunk_I_J.glb` next to the .blend, with origin and scale set. Your master terrain isn't changed.
